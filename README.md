## More Ideas
Some artwork ideas:

- glaucus loves swimming in the sea (the network sea) with Tux (the Linux
mascot) and Puffy (the OpenBSD mascot)

- all 4 flavours of glaucus swimming together with atlanticus leading the pack,
and thompsoni as his right-hand scientist that ensures they're all secure, and
bennettae being the smallest of the bunch, and albino being the purest of them
all (refer to the [Naming Convention](
https://github.com/firasuke/glaucus/wiki/Naming-Convention) page on the wiki if
you didn't understand a word of what I just said).
