## More Ideas
Some artwork ideas:

* glaucus loves swimming in the sea (the network sea) with Tux (the Linux
  mascot) and Puffy (the OpenBSD mascot)

* all 4 flavours of glaucus swimming together with atlanticus leading the pack,
  and thompsoni as his right-hand scientist that ensures they're all secure, and
  bennettae being the smallest of the bunch, and albino being the purest of them
  all (refer to the [Naming Convention](
  https://github.com/glaucuslinux/glaucus/wiki/Naming-Convention) page on the
  wiki if you didn't understand a word of what I just said).
